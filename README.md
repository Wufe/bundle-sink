# BundleSink

Manage multiple webpack entries within an ASPNET Core application.

***

### Requirements

- The library currently supports `netcoreapp3.1` applications.
- You need a webpack configuration for your bundles.

***

## Installation

- From the dotnet CLI:  
`dotnet add package BundleSink`

- Import tag helpers within `_ViewImports.cshtml`:  
`@addTagHelper *, BundleSink`

- From a command line:
`npm install webpack-assets-manifest`

- Update your webpack.config.js adding the plugin:
```js
    plugins: [
        new WebpackAssetsManifest({
            output: path.resolve(__dirname, 'client-manifest.json'),
            entrypoints: true
        })
    ]
```

- Initialize BundleSink in Program.cs:

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
        {
            webBuilder
                .ConfigureBundleSink(builder => {
                    builder.WithWebpack("client-manifest.json", "/dist/");
                })
                .UseStartup<Startup>();
        });
```

> The function `WithWebpack` requires two arguments:
> - The name of the assets manifest created with webpack
> - The **public** output folder (i.e. the folder under wwwroot where the output is being generated by webpack)

***

## Usage

- Place a script-sink in your `_Layout.cshtml` or a razor page's "Scripts" section:  

*e.g.:  

```razor
<h1>Homepage</h1>

@section Scripts {
    <script-sink />
}
```

- Use a webpack entry from within a partial view / view-component, defining **the name of the entry**

```razor
This is a partial view from the homepage

<webpack-entry name="my-homepage-feature" />
```

***

## What happened
The `<webpack-entry>` tag helper marked the specified entry as a dependency.  
The `<script-sink>` tag helper uses the dependencies declared all over the razor pages, taking care of duplicates and required chunks

The html will contain the scripts required for the selected entries.
